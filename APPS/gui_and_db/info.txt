library used for gui: tkinter   (script1,10)
db used: SQLite3                (script2,20)
         PostgreSql             (script3,)
- SQLite3 is not a client/server db, but it is embedded into the end program

import sqlite3   # for SQLite3       (comes with standard lib)
import psycopg2  # for PostgreSql    (use pip to get it)

5 main steps to work with a db:
    1. connect to a db
    2. create a cursor object - it's like a pointer to access rows from a table from db
    3. write an sql query
    4. commit the changes
    5. close the connection


PostgreSql needs to be installed separately

default port: 5432
default location: C:\PostgreSQL\data\pg10
