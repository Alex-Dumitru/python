windows have the hosts file here:  C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
in mac/linux:                      etc/hosts

if you want to block a website, like www.facebook.com, you can fill the Hosts file with:
127.0.0.1 www.facebook.com

- this will redirect www.facebook.com to localhost

What the program will do:
- we can make an infinite loop (while True) that will check all the time for current time, and then do the following:
    - if time is between 8 and 16 then it will write that line in the hosts file
    (this way, whenever you will try to access it during this period of time, you will not be able to)
    - if it's outside that time frame it will rewrite the file without the websites that you have in the list for blocked sites

Schedule the program to run in the background:
- run python script in the background as a process in task manager
    - 1st you need to change the extention from .py to .pyw This will change also the program which runs your script to pythonw.exe (C:\Users\dumal01\Python\Python36)
    - you can simply double-click the file and it will run in task manager as a process, and not in terminal
    - if it doesn't run from the 1st time, make sure you are running it as an administrator
    - in task manager, the process will be shown as "pythonw.exe" and not by the file name
- start at PC startup
    - go to Task Scheduler
    - create Task
    - give it a name
    - check box "run with highest privileges"
    - from dropdown list "Configure for:" choose your Windows version
    - then go to Triggers
    - select New
    - Begin the task: At startup
    - then go to Actions
    - Action: Start a program
    - then by selecting Browse, find your python script
    - then go to Conditions
    - you may want to uncheck box "Start the task only if the computer is on AC power" (to enable to run also on battery, for laptops)
    - press OK
    - now the task should be in the list (ready) to run when the computer starts
    - you can also Run it directly


If you want to use it under linux:
- make sure you change the path to the hosts file
- and you can implement the scheduler in cron
sudo crontab -e
you can add the following line:
@reboot python3 /path/to/file/blocker.py

! when scheduled in these 2 ways, the script is executed from another directory so make sure to not use relative paths, and only use full path specification
